# Capstone_Project_1

In this project, we will analyze body measurement data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset for adult males and females. We will use Python and various libraries including NumPy and Matplotlib to perform data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. We explored weight distributions, compared gender-specific measurements through histograms and boxplots, and calculated BMI. By standardizing data and examining correlations, we evaluated relationships between body metrics. Additionally, we computed and compared waist-to-height and waist-to-hip ratios. The analysis provides insights into body composition and measurement variability, offering valuable information for health assessments and comparison across genders.
