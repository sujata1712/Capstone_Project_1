# Capstone_Project_1

For this project, we are going to analyze body measurements data of NHANES dataset among adult males and females only. The data management, analysis, and visualization shall be performed using Python with other libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib. This is where we placed density equalization, positioning histograms of gender-specific measurements, and calculating BMI. Therefore, these data were converted into a standard form, and the coefficients of correlation were used for evaluating the role of body measuresâ€™ dependencies. Besides this, we also divided the Waist circumference in two ways i.e., Waist to height and Waist to hip ratios. The results provide information on various aspects of body size and weight relationships, which gives a more comprehensive understanding of gender differences in this context.
